## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The project was interesting, it look simple at first but requires a lot of trick to layout the page correctly, the part i enjoyed most is the fact that i was able to code everything on my own without making any reference to external source. it's a great improvement from my own end and also gives me more confidence to tackle a harder chanllenge.
